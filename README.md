# logo-generator
A command line application that allows a user to create a logo after answering some prompts on the command line

## Description

- I was motivated to create this logo generator because it was a great opportunity to learn about object oriented programming and how we can generate an image for a user just by asking them a few questions.
- I created this project to work on my Node JS skills, particularly when it comes to using object oriented programming and Jest testing to make sure everything is running as planned.
- By creating this application, I solved the problem of a user needing to pay a graphic designer to generate a logo. Now a logo can be easily generated.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using javascript in Node JS and how to create classes that can inherent from one another which is very useful.

## Installation

- In order to use this application, the user will need to have access to the command line.
- Once they are in the command line, they will need to cd into the logo-generator folder.
- Once in the folder, the user will have to run node index.js in the command line.
- From there, the user will be prompted to answer questions that will in turn generate a new logo for them.


## Usage

- The use of this command line application is to generate a logo for the user after they have answered some question regarding what they would like included.

- When the user starts the application using node index.js, they are then prompted with a series of questions.
- When a user enters information in about the 3 characters they would like included, the color they would like the text, the shape of the logo, and the color of the logo, they enter this information and it is reflected in the result.
- The user will then be returned a SVG logo that matches the specifications they included.
